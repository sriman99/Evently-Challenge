# 🏗️ Evently System Architecture

## Overview

Evently is a high-performance, scalable event ticketing platform built with modern technologies to handle thousands of concurrent booking requests. The system emphasizes concurrency control, fault tolerance, and real-time performance.

**Visual Diagram**: See [Evently-Architecture.png](./Evently-Architecture.png) for the complete system architecture diagram.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 🚀 Performance & Scalability
- **Async-First Design**: FastAPI with full async/await support for non-blocking operations
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized PostgreSQL connection management with configurable pools
- **Redis Caching**: In-memory caching for seat availability and user sessions
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless application design ready for load balancer distribution

### 🔒 Concurrency & Data Integrity
- **Optimistic Locking**: Prevents race conditions during seat booking
- **Redis Reservations**: Temporary seat locks during booking process
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction management with compensation
- **Database Transactions**: ACID compliance for critical booking operations

### 🛡️ Security & Authentication
- **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication with configurable expiration
- **Role-Based Access Control**: User, Admin, and Organizer permission levels
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive Pydantic schema validation
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoint protection against abuse

## Technology Stack

### Backend Framework
- **FastAPI**: High-performance async web framework
- **Python 3.12**: Latest Python with performance optimizations
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for production deployment

### Database Layer
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database with async driver (asyncpg)
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM with async support and migration management
- **Redis**: Caching and temporary data storage

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Railway**: Cloud deployment platform
- **Docker**: Containerization support (optional)
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline integration

## System Components

### 🌐 API Gateway Layer
- **Authentication Middleware**: JWT token validation and user context
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable request throttling per user/endpoint
- **CORS Management**: Cross-origin request handling
- **Request/Response Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail

### 🏢 Business Logic Layer
- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, profile management
- **Event Management**: CRUD operations with venue relationships
- **Booking Engine**: Seat reservation with concurrency control
- **Payment Processing**: Integration-ready payment gateway support
- **Notification System**: User communication for booking updates

### 💾 Data Layer
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Primary data storage with relationships
- **Redis Cache**: Session storage and seat reservation locks
- **File Storage**: Static asset management (venue images, etc.)

### 📊 Analytics & Monitoring
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Application performance monitoring
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs for observability
- **Health Checks**: Kubernetes-compatible liveness and readiness probes

## Concurrency Handling Strategy

### 🎯 Booking Flow Concurrency
1. **Seat Selection**: Redis-based temporary reservations (5-minute TTL)
2. **Optimistic Locking**: Database version control on seat entities
3. **Saga Transactions**: Multi-step booking with automatic rollback
4. **Compensation Actions**: Cleanup failed bookings and release locks

### ⚡ Performance Optimizations
- **Connection Pooling**: Configurable database connection management
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking I/O for database and Redis operations
- **Strategic Caching**: Frequently accessed data cached in Redis
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries on high-traffic endpoints

## Scalability Design

### 📈 Horizontal Scaling
- **Stateless Application**: No server-side session storage
- **Load Balancer Ready**: Multiple instance deployment support
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas and connection pooling
- **Cache Distribution**: Redis cluster support for high availability

### 🔄 Fault Tolerance
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic failure detection and recovery
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry policies for external services
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial functionality during component failures
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous system health assessment

## Security Architecture

### 🛡️ Authentication Flow
1. **User Registration**: Secure password hashing with bcrypt
2. **Login Process**: JWT token generation with refresh capability
3. **Token Validation**: Middleware-based request authentication
4. **Role Authorization**: Endpoint-level permission enforcement

### 🔐 Data Protection
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with configurable rounds
- **Token Security**: Signed JWT with expiration and blacklisting
- **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive request validation
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries via SQLAlchemy

## API Design Principles

### 🌐 RESTful Architecture
- **Resource-Based URLs**: Clear, predictable endpoint structure
- **HTTP Method Semantics**: Proper use of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- **Status Codes**: Meaningful HTTP response codes
- **Content Negotiation**: JSON-first with schema validation

### 📝 Documentation & Testing
